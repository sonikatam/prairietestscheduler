### Slots Not Detected

```
Error: Extension not finding available slots
```

**Solution:**

- Check that you're on a page with slot information
- The extension may need selector adjustments for your specific PrairieTest instance

## üîÑ Customization

### Adjusting Slot Detection

If the extension isn't detecting slots properly, you may need to adjust the selectors in `content.js`:

```javascript
// In content.js, modify these selectors:
const slotSelectors = [
  ".slot:not(.booked)",
  ".time-slot:not(.occupied)",
  ".available-slot",
  // Add your specific selectors here
];
```

### Adding Email Integration

To enable email notifications, integrate with an email service:

```javascript
// In background.js, replace the webhook with your email service
const emailService = "https://your-email-service.com/send";
```
